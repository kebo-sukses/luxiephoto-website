## Building Your Dream Portfolio

Creating a compelling wedding photography portfolio is essential for attracting your ideal clients. Here are some tips to help you showcase your best work.

### 1. Quality Over Quantity

Only showcase your absolute best work. It's better to have 20 stunning images than 100 mediocre ones.

### 2. Tell a Story

Arrange your portfolio to tell the story of a wedding day, from preparation to reception.

### 3. Show Variety

Include different lighting conditions, venues, and wedding styles to demonstrate your versatility.
